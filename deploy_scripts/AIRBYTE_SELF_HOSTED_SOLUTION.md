# Airbyte Source Definitions Problem and Self-Hosted Solution

## The Problem

When trying to access source definitions through the Airbyte Cloud API, you encountered a "Forbidden" error with status code 403. This error occurs because:

1. **Airbyte Cloud API Restrictions**: The Airbyte Cloud API restricts access to source definitions for regular API users. These definitions are managed by Airbyte Cloud administrators.

2. **Permission Model**: In Airbyte Cloud, the API credentials you create through the UI don't have permission to access source definitions, even if your user account has admin privileges.

3. **API Endpoint Limitations**: The `/source_definitions` endpoint is restricted in the Airbyte Cloud environment to prevent users from modifying the available connectors.

## The Solution: Self-Hosted Airbyte

The solution is to use a self-hosted Airbyte instance instead of Airbyte Cloud. Here's why this works:

1. **Full API Access**: With a self-hosted Airbyte instance, you have full admin access to all API endpoints, including source definitions.

2. **No Permission Restrictions**: You control the entire environment, so there are no permission restrictions on any API endpoints.

3. **Complete Control**: You can customize the Airbyte instance to suit your specific needs.

## Key Differences Between Airbyte Cloud and Self-Hosted

| Feature | Airbyte Cloud | Self-Hosted Airbyte |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Source Definitions API | Restricted access | Full access |
| Authentication | OAuth with client ID/secret | Basic auth or no auth |
| API Endpoints | Some endpoints restricted | All endpoints available |
| Deployment | Managed by Airbyte | Managed by you |
| Customization | Limited | Full control |

## Implementation Details

The key changes needed to make your Airbyte POC work with a self-hosted instance:

1. **API URL**: Change from `https://api.airbyte.com/v1` to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

2. **Authentication**: Remove OAuth authentication and use either no authentication or basic authentication

3. **Source Definitions Endpoint**: Use workspace-specific endpoints:
   - From: `/source_definitions`
   - To: `/workspaces/{workspaceId}/source_definitions`

4. **Client Implementation**: Update the AirbyteClient.js file to work with the self-hosted API structure

## How to Deploy

We've provided a script (`run-self-hosted-airbyte.sh`) that:

1. Sets up a self-hosted Airbyte instance using Docker
2. Clones your Airbyte POC repository
3. Updates the code to work with the self-hosted instance
4. Starts both Airbyte and your POC application

After running this script, you'll have:
- Airbyte UI at http://localhost:8000
- Your POC application at http://localhost:3000

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Development Simplicity**: Easier to develop and test locally
2. **Full Control**: Complete control over the Airbyte environment
3. **No API Limitations**: Access to all API endpoints without restrictions
4. **Customization**: Ability to customize Airbyte to your specific needs

This approach allows your POC to work as intended, with full access to source definitions and other API endpoints that might be restricted in Airbyte Cloud.
